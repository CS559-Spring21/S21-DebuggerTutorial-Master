# CS559 - Spring 2021 VSCode Debugger Tutorial

This is a tutorial to help students get started using the Visual Studio Code Debugger.

The tutorial is in workbook form: students should clone it and read it as they would a regular workbook. We are not "collecting" these workbooks - there is no need to commit your changes (unless you want to), and you cannot `push` things back to GitHub.

This workbook was originally written by Peer Mentor Gia-Phong Nguyen with contributions from the rest of the course staff.
