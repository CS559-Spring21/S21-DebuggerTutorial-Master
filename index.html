    This is a short workbook on how to use the debugger for your javascript programs. 
    If you already know how to use the debugger, this probably won't have any new information
    since I will only be covering the basics about the debugger. But if you are still using print statements
    to debug, you might want to look at this.
</p>

<p>
    While console.log does work, it is quite limited, tedious, and slow when
    there is a lot to debug. The debugger gives you a lot more control over where to slow down
    in your code and what values are stored in which variables and is much faster to use. The debugger is also not hard to
    use either, it is quite intuitive and I think it is well worth learning.
</p>

<p>
    This workbook should show you how to setup the debugger in VS Code as well as how to use it
    through some worked examples. Hopefully you will find this helpful throughout the semester and after.
    If you haven't used the debugger before, please look through this guide as spending a few minutes
    learning this could save you hours in the long run.
