    The main use of console.log is to check on certain values or write messages that
    indicate if the code has gone through a certain point. We can do that much more easily
    using the Log Message option when editing a breakpoint. This will create a logpoint.
</p>

<p>
    Using the logpoint, we can type in a message at any point in the code. <b>NOTE:</b> 
    we cannot set a breakpoint on top of a logpoint. If there is an expression or hit count set, it will
    override the logpoint and no message will appear.
</p>

<p>
    With the logpoint you can also print values as you would using console.log by adding {} around
    your variables.

<h2>Box (Exercise): Logging</h2>

<p>
    Below is a square going in circle which can be found in <code>4-1.js</code>.
</p>

<iframe src="../../for_students/4-1.html" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" 
    style="overflow:hidden;height:100%;width:100%;border: 2px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>

<p>
    Let us add the following logpoint to line 40:
</p>

<p>
    <code>Square Info: r: {square.r}, g: {square.g}, b: {square.b}, x: {square.x}, y: {square.y}</code>
</p>

<p>
    Refresh the page and we will be able to see message logged at in the Debug Console in the lower tab
    of VS Code. You can also see this logged in the Window as well if you press Ctrl + Shift + i and look at
    the window there. The message should look like this.
</p>

<img src="../../images/loginfo1.PNG" width="650">

<p>
    This seems like a somewhat tedious thing to type though. So instead, we can try logging 
    the square directly. Let's replace the logpoint message we made with this one below:
</p>

<p>
    <code>Square Info: {square}</code>
</p>

<p>
    When we run this, it will log the values of the square variable directly.
    We can click the little carrot on the left of the variable in the debug console to see all it's values. It should look like this:
</p>

<img src="../../images/loginfo2.PNG" width="650">

<p>
    You will notice that the values greyed out are the same but the ones below those are wrong. This might be because
    we are logging an object, there may be a delay in how it logs the values. Meaning it may try log the square then,
    but will finish logging after some of the animation has occurred. You will notice that those values change everytime we refresh.
</p>

<p>
    If we added a breakpoint on line 42, those values should be accurate since the code will pause before any changes happens
    to the square, and it will accurately log the square at that time.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note: </b> this is also the same if we were to use the <code>console.log()</code> function.
</p>

<h3>Loops</h3>

<p>
    Here we logged the square before we entered the animation loop. If you were to put this same logpoint
    somewhere in the animation loop such as on line 43, you will notice that you will get swarmed by messages
    updating you on the values of the square. This may be useful, but there is much cleaner way to keep track of
    certain values shown below.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note: </b>if you add logpoints in this animation loop, you do not need to refresh that page
    after it has already started running, because you will reach that breakpoint again.
</p>

<h3>Watching Values</h3>

<p>
    In the debug tab, there are three sections: <b>Variables, Watch, </b> and <b> Call Stack</b>.
    We already talked about the call stack, but not the other two. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Variables</b> contains all the variables currently saved while running your program. If we pause our program
    in the debugger, all the variables will show up. Variables will also show anytime we hit a breakpoint.
    We can find the variables we want to observe in here and we <b>can also modify it</b>. Try modifying <code>t</code> 
    after pausing the program and continue. You will notice that the square will jump positions.
</p>

<img src="../../images/variables.PNG" width="300">

<p>
    <b>Watch</b> holds the variables we wish to constantly track. If we right click on a variable
    in <b>Variables</b>, we can 'Add to Watch'. Add the square to Watch. Anytime we stop the program (either by breakpoint or pause), 
    we can see the square's information displayed in watch the same as how we logged it earlier. It should look something like this:
</p>

<img src="../../images/watch.PNG" width="300">

<p>
    This program runs an animation loop in the <code>animate()</code> function. You can 
    set a breakpoint on line 43 and keep continuing iteratively to see how the square changes
    on each animation frame.
</p>

<p>
    Also feel free to try the things from the previous pages on this page
    such as expressions and stepping.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    Essentially, you can still log messages and values in the console when you need to. Hopefully
    doing it this way will prove to be faster and also leave less of a mess compared to calling the <code>console.log()</code> function. 
    Also watching values should also be useful since you don't have to constantly log
    values at various points in time during your code.
