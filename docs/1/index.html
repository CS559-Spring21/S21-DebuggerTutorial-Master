    This section will cover how to set up the debugger for this workbook as well as future workbooks and other
    projects you may want to debug in the future.
</p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>
    For this setup, we're going to be using Chrome but this also works with many other browsers.
</p>

<p>
    First, install the debugger for Chrome. You can find it by going to the extensions tab found
    on the left of the VS Code window. Search up 'Debugger for Chrome' and install it.
</p>

<p> 
    Run the live server for your page (It should already be running for this
    Debugger WB).
</p>

<p>
    The next step may look a little different depending on whether or not you already have
    debug launch configs set up for debugging.
</p>

<h3>If there are no launch configs</h3>

<p>
    Click on the run/debug tab to the left. Click on <b>Run and Debug</b>.
</p>

<img src="../../images/run and debug.PNG" width="300">

<h3>If there are already launch configs</h3>

<p> 
    Click on the run/debug tab to the left. Go to the top and click the scrolldown.
    Click on 'Add Config (<code>[Name of Workbook]</code>)'.
</p>

<img src="../../images/add config.png" width="300">

<h3>The steps after should be the same</h3>

<p>
    It will then ask you to select an environment, in which you will just select what 
    browser you use to open your page, which for this example will be Chrome (It might be <code>Chrome (legacy)</code>). If you didn't install
    the Debugger for Chrome, Chrome will not show up as an option.
</p>

<img src="../../images/select environment.png" width="650">

<p> 
    Now this <code>launch.json</code> file should open up and it can be found in the newly added <code>.vscode</code> folder
    of this workbook. We need to modify the url so that the port matches the one we are using
    for the live server.
</p>

<p>
    We are now done with setting up the debugger for VS Code.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> we only have to do this once per folder. If you open up a folder that you already set up the debugger for,
    the launch settings will be saved in <code>launch.json</code> in the <code>.vscode</code> folder. This effects the entire folder, you don't
    have to worry about doing this for each individual file.
</p>

<h3>Running the debugger</h3>

<p>
    Now try running the debugger. It can only run when the live server is open.
    You can run the debugger by clicking the arrow next to your launch tab.
</p>

<img src="../../images/start debugger.jpg" width="400">

<p>
    It should open a new window with your page site. In VS Code, you should see this debugger 
    bar at the top of VS Code. You'll also notice that the bar at the bottom turns orange.
</p>

<h2>Box (Exercise): First breakpoints</h2>

<p>
    Now lets set some breakpoints. Below is a canvas with four squares. 
    The javascript for this can be found in <code>1-1.js</code>. You will see that there are
    four functions and each gets called to draw a square. To the left of the line
    number for any line, you can click to add a breakpoint, or click again to remove it.
</p>

<p>
    Lets add a breakpoint on each function (lines 27-30). 
</p>

<img src="../../images/breakpoints.png" width="650">

<p>
    In the new debugger window, go to this page. It should be paused in the debugger bar in VS Code.
    <b>If you were already on this page, refresh it so that the breakpoints activate.</b>
    If you set the breakpoints correctly, you will see that the canvas is empty. You can click on 'continue'
    in the debugger bar to go to the next breakpoint. You will notice
    that each square will appear as you continue as the code is paused at each breakpoint.
</p>

    style="overflow:hidden;height:100%;width:100%;border: 2px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>

<p>
    <b>One more thing of note, make sure you continue all the way or remove/disable all breakpoints and refresh when you want to leave the page
        while debugging. You won't be able to leave the page until you do.
    </b> Of course, if you are done debugging, you can simply end the debugging session anytime by closing out the window.
</p>

<p>
    At the bottom of the debug section, there is a <b>BREAKPOINTS</b> tab. If you hover over
    the tab, you will see 3 actions you can do, the one on the far right will allow you to instantly
    remove all breakpoints.
</p>

<img src="../../images/remove breakpoints.jpg" width="400">

<h3>When do breakpoints activate?</h3>

<p>
    Breakpoints pause the program when the line of the breakpoint is reached. So if you have already reached the end
    of the program and then you add a breakpoint, it won't do anything since you already went past the breakpoint, you would
    have to refresh the page to reach it again.
</p>

<p>
    A breakpoint can still activate if you add it after starting your program without having to refresh. This would
    occur in things like mouse events or animation loops where functions may get called again after time has passed, and if you
    placed a breakpoint in those repeated functions before it gets called, it will pause when it does. 
    We can see this later in section 4's exercise.
</p>

<h3>Too many windows?</h3>

<p>
    Right now, it seems like it takes 3 windows to debug: VS Code, the live server window, and the debugger window.
    If this is too hard to cram on the screen, we can close out/ignore/minimize the live server window. The live server is running,
    we can run the debugger irregardless of if the window is already open regularly. You could instead do everything in the debugger window.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
    
<p>
    This was essentally how we setup the VS Code debugger to run. While just being able to pause a program
    on a line may seem powerful on its own, there is much more that can be done.
    Next we will look at stepping through our code.
