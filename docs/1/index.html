    I will start by saying that you don't have to use the debugger in VS Code, since Google Chrome's
    devtools allow you to debug directly in the browser. If you press Ctrl + Shift + i and go to Sources, 
    you can look for the js file you want to debug and directly add breakpoints to your code there.
</p>

<p>
    For the exercise box at the bottom of this page, it would be:
</p>

<p>
    <code>1-1.html -> 127.0.0.1:[port] -> for_students -> 1-1.js</code>
</p>

<p>
    If you are fine with using the debugger in Chrome, you can skip to the exercise at the bottom
    and go from there. But in my opinion, the debugger in VS Code looks much nicer.
</p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>
    For this setup, we're going to be using Chrome but this also works with Firefox 
    as well as other browsers.
</p>

<p>
    First, install the debugger for Chrome. You can find it by going to the extensions tab found
    on the left of the VS Code window. Search up 'Debugger for Chrome' and install it.

</p>

<p> 
    Run the live server for your page (It should already be running for this
    Debugger WB).
</p>

<p>
    The next step depends on whether you are working on a single folder
    or are working in a workspace. (Generally speaking, a workspace will have multiple folders)
</p>

<h3>If working in a single folder</h3>

<p>
    Click on the run/debug tab to the left. Click on <b>Run and Debug</b>.
</p>

<h3>If working in a workspace</h3>

<p> 
    Click on the run/debug tab to the left. Go to the top and click the scrolldown.
    Click on 'Add Config (Debugging WB)'.
</p>

<img src="../../images/add config.png" width="300">

<h3>The steps after should be the same</h3>

<p>
    It will then ask you to select an environment, in which you will just select what 
    browser you use to open your page, which for this example will be Chrome. If you didn't install
    the Debugger for Chrome, Chrome will not show up as an option.
</p>

<img src="../../images/select environment.png" width="650">

<p> 
    Now this <code>launch.json</code> file should open up and it can be found in the newly added <code>.vscode</code> folder
    of this workbook. We need to modify the url so that the port matches the one we are using
    for the live server.
</p>

<img src="../../images/change port.jpg" width="650">

<p>
    We are now done with setting up the debugger for VS Code.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> we only have to do this once per folder. If you open up a folder that you already set up the debugger for,
    the launch settings will be saved in <code>launch.json</code> in the <code>.vscode</code> folder.
</p>

<h3>Running the debugger</h3>

<p>
    Now try running the debugger. It can only run when the live server is open.
    You can run the debugger by click the arrow next to your launch tab.
</p>

<img src="../../images/start debugger.jpg" width="400">

<p>
    It should open a new window with your page site. In VS Code, you should see this debugger 
    bar at the top of VS Code. You'll also notice that the bar at the bottom turns orange.
</p>

<img src="../../images/debugger bar.PNG" width="650">

<h2>Box (Exercise): First breakpoints</h2>

<p>
    Now lets set some breakpoints. Below is a canvas with four squares. 
    The javascript for this can be found in <code>1-1.js</code>. You will see that there are
    four functions and each gets called to draw a square. To the left of the line
    number for any line, you can click to add a breakpoint, or click again to remove it.
</p>

<p>
    Lets add a breakpoint on each function (lines 27-30). 
</p>

<img src="../../images/breakpoints.png" width="650">

<p>
    In the new window, go to this page. It should be paused in the debugger bar in VS Code.
    If you set the breakpoints correctly, you will see that the canvas is empty. You can click on continue
    on the debugger bar to go to the next breakpoint. You will notice
    that each square will appear as you continue as the code is paused at each breakpoint.
</p>

    style="overflow:hidden;height:100%;width:100%;border: 2px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>

<p>
    <b>One more thing of note, make sure you continue all the way or remove/disable all breakpoints and refresh when you want to leave the page
        while debugging. You won't be able to leave the page until you do.
    </b> Of course, if you are done debugging, you can simply end the debugging session anytime by closing out the window.
</p>

<p>
    At the bottom of the debug tab, there is a <b>Breakpoints</b> tab. If you hover over
    the tab, you will see 3 actions you can do, the one on the far right will allow you to instantly
    remove all breakpoints.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
    
<p>
    This was essentally how we setup the VS Code debugger to run. You can of course just use the Chrome devtools
    if you prefer those, but going forward, it shouldn't matter which you use. Next we will look at stepping through our code.
