    With breakpoints, you can also set them to stop your program on certain conditions.
</p>

<p>
    If you right click on a breakpoint you've made, you can edit the breakpoint as well as
    remove it or enable/disable it. 
</p>

<p>
    When you are editing a breakpoint, you can set it to Expression which will make the breakpoint
    only stop the program if the condition you set is met at the breakpoint. Make sure you hit Enter
    after setting your expression to save the breakpoint conditional. You can also hit Esc to cancel.

<h2>Box (Exercise): Conditional Statements</h2>

<p>
    Below is a canvas with a green square, but if you look at <code>3-1.js</code>, you will see that
    there is a for loop that keeps drawing a different colored square. Lets set a breakpoint
    on line 24 and run the debugger. 
</p>

<p>
    Nothing should appear when on the canvas at the breakpoint. If we keep continuing,
    We will first see a reddish square that slowly changes colors.
</p>

<p>
    Now edit that breakpoint and go to Expression. Set it to <code>g == 100</code>.
    This will make it so that the breakpoint only stops the program when g == 100. You
    should see a brownish square when the debugger pauses then. If we continue, it should jump to
    the end and we'll get the green square again.
</p>

    style="overflow:hidden;height:100%;width:100%;border: 2px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>
    
<p>
    You can also try this with other expressions. Anything you can write in an if statements you can write
    in the Expression. Also try using other values such as the r value or the i value.
</p>

<h3>Hit Count</h3>

<p>
    You will notice that below the Expression option, you can also select Hit Count. Hit count basically
    makes it so that the breakpoint will pause the program when a breakpoint has been reached a certain number of
    times. However when you refresh the page, it will remember the count from before so if you set it to something like
    <code>%100</code>, It will pause the program at g == 99, g == 199, and then when you refresh, it will pause at
    g == 44, g == 144...
</p>

<p>
    To reset, you have to rerun the debugger. It can be handy at times but Expression should be mostly enough.
</p>

<h2 id="summary-two-apis">Summary</h2>

<p>
    We have the power to set the breakpoints to only activate when we want them to. This can save us
    a lot of time when we only want the program to stop on when a specific value is reached.
