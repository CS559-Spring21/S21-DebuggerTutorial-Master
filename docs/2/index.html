    From the last page we saw how to continue to the next breakpoint, but there
    are some other things we to progress through our code in the debugger bar.
</p>

<img src="../../images/debugger bar.PNG" width="650">

<p>
    From the bar you can do the following things:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Continue/Pause:</b> Continues to the next breakpoint or end of program. Pauses the program
        if it is continuously running in say an animation loop.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Step Over:</b> Goes to the immediate next line of code.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Step In:</b> Goes into the next line in a function if applicable, otherwise goes to the immediate
        next line of code
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Step Out:</b> Goes out of the function it is currently in and continues to next line
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Restart:</b> Refreshes the page
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Stop:</b> Ends debugging and closes the window
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Box (Exercise): Stepping</h2>

<p>
    Below is a canvas with a green square. You can find the javascript in <code>2-1.js</code>. Let's set a breakpoint
    on line 23 and run the debugger.
</p>

<iframe src="../../for_students/2-1.html" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" 
    style="overflow:hidden;height:100%;width:100%;border: 2px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>

<p>
    If we step over, we will get a pink square and if we step over against, we will get the green square.
    You will notice that the debugger simply goes to the next line of code regardless what happens in the function.
</p>

<p>
    Lets restart step in this time. Now you will see that the debugger goes into func1(), and if you keep stepping in,
    we will go into func3(), complete it, go back into func1(), complete it, and then the same for func2(). You will see
    that we drew a blue square, and pink square, and a green square in the order.
</p>

<p>
    Lets restart and step into func3() again. This time step out as soon as we get into func3(). You will see that it immediately
    completes the function and goes back into func1() and draw the blue square. If we were to step out after immediately entering func1(),
    we will not see the blue square because the pink square is also immedately drawn after. Essentially, step out finishes the current function and continues
    to the next line after the function call.
</p>

<h3>The Call Stack</h3>

<p>
    You can tell where we will continue from by looking at the Call Stack in the debugger tab. The image below shows what
    the Call Stack should look like when we step into func3(). We can see that func3() is at the top of the stack, and we can see that if we step out,
    we will back into func1(), and then if we step out again we would be in the window.onload() function.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    These are the basics of how to step through your programs. Feel free to play around with this some more if
    you are not entirely sure how this works.
